The preservation of private keys has always been a problem, It's a good idea to hide the secret key in picture(png/jpg) through the steganography algorithm(LSB)

Written in pure go, <b>100% open source for safety</b>, and all code runs purely locally, without any network communication. at the same time, it is recommended to disconnect the network during operation to ensure absolute safety, the GUI built with [fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne).

# :rocket: Features
